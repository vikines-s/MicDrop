## Domain

The project domain of this application is data analysis and algorithmic matching. We will obtain a wide range of data from a set of users, analyze the data, and then use a series of algorithms to match users based on the data they have provided. 

A distinctive feature of this application will be the ability to send songs directly from one device to another, much like Apple's "AirDrop" feature for sharing content. This feature 

The main goal of the matching algorithms is optimization, i.e. finding one or more "optimal" matches. However, unlike traditional matching algorithms whose output depends directly on input provided, our algorithms will also analyze possible trends in the data, use these patterns to predict the kind of data the user will provide in the future, and use the predicted data alongside the given data to match users together. Taking predicted data into account introduces a more personalized approach to creating meaningful matches; users will not only be paired based on how similar their music tastes are, but also on the potential to evolve and enliven each other's music taste and form a connection based on that!   


## Overview

Our team is looking to create a music dating app called MicDrop (tentative) that matches people based on the similarity of their music taste. We will use the spotify API to read users listening history and trends and then match them based on similarity of the genres and artists they listen to, as well as location.

## API Options
